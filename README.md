##  How It Works

     In this Project I have created an website for Gotham Municipal Corporation,where user can
     take an Appoinement and Depending on location of the patients, they have assigned the   
     hospitals.

     --> User first have to Register by Signing up button . 

     --> After that they have to login .

     --> After logging in user can Book an Appointment by providing some information about their 
         Health and their Location . 
    
     --> Based on thir location one Hospital will be Assignned among four Hospital.

     --> After he Hospital is assigned , The Hospital will assign an ambulance for the User and which
         is scheduled to reach the Location of user.
    
     --> Besides Appointment,User can also read about COVID-19 desease in the Website .

     --> Log out option is there to Log out.

      I have used HTML,CSS and JavaScript to complete the Project , No backend and Database is included
     in this Project . I have used Local Storage to store the username and password of the User and validate
    them at the time of Logging in.
